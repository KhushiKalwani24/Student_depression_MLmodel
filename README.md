📌 Overview

Student mental health is a growing global concern. Academic pressure, lifestyle imbalance, social isolation, and personal challenges can significantly impact students' psychological well-being.

This project applies Machine Learning techniques to predict the likelihood of depression among students based on various behavioral and academic factors.

The goal is to:

📊 Analyze patterns in student data

🤖 Build a predictive ML model

📈 Evaluate performance using classification metrics

💡 Provide insights that could support early intervention systems
